## What is "Binary search"?
&emsp; Binary search is a kind of search algorithm which could find the target value within a "sorted array", sorted array means the elements in this array are sequenced in ascending order. This search algorithm could compare the target with the middle element in that array and judges which half the target should lie. Then the search continues on the remaining half until finding the element with the same value as the target and return the position index of this element. However, if the search ends with empty, the target does not belong to the array.
